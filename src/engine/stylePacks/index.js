// It sits BEHIND the far hill range — drawn before that layer, so the range's
// crests cut across its flanks and only the summit clears the ridgeline. That
// occlusion is the depth cue doing the work; scale alone cannot sell distance
// against flat silhouettes. Two things follow from being back there:
//
//   - Its height is set against its occluder, not chosen freely: the far crests
//     reach ~96px, so the cone must clear that to exist at all, but only by
//     enough to show its molten cap. Overshoot it and the volcano towers over
//     the range instead of standing behind it, which reads as foreground again.
//   - It parallaxes SLOWER than the far layer, so it drifts behind the range
//     as the camera moves rather than travelling locked to it.
//
// It is drawn in the same flat-cartoon language as the props (sprites/props.js):
// flat fills, one dark outline, no gradients — a mauve-slate cone with a lit
// face and a shadow face, a molten cap that has overflowed the crater and
// congealed in drips down the upper slopes, flows running the rest of the way,
// and billowing smoke off the summit.
//
// Distance here is carried ENTIRELY by occlusion, scale and parallax — not by
// haze. An earlier pass also desaturated the palette and thinned the outline,
// which is the usual way to push something back, but it made the volcano read
// as atmosphere rather than as art: the whole point is that it is a drawn
// cartoon object in the reference's style, and bold linework is what says so.
// So the ink and fills stay at reference weight even back here.
//
// Palette note: the lava yellow tops out around 0.75 luma, under the glfx.js

// it. Rebuilding all of that per frame cost ~1.1ms of the ~2.3ms this function
// used to spend, for an image identical to the previous frame's.
//
// So the fixed stack is rasterised ONCE into bake canvases, and the layer is
// composed at a FIXED subpixel phase (`CXB`) instead of at the live `cx`. The

// A dried coffee ring. The previous attempt stroked an uneven circle, which
// still read as a drawn O — because a stain has no edges at all. What actually
// identifies one:
//   - it is SOAKED IN, so it multiplies the page rather than covering it, and
//     the rules stay visible through it, darkened;
//   - the rim is a soft band, not a line — liquid wicks into paper fibre, so
//     both sides of it fade out;
//   - the mug got set down more than once.
// So it is built from soft radial-gradient annuli instead of strokes. Three
// near-coincident passes make the rim uneven where they overlap, which beats
// any deliberate wobble, and a fourth offset pass is the second placement.
